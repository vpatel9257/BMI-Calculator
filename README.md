# BMI-Calculator
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator interface. The calculator helps determine the health of a person based on their height 
and weight measurements. Height and weight measurements are key indicators in determining a person’s BMI score. The BMI score will be displayed 
after the measurements are recorded in the interface. The result will be displayed with a number and a phrase stating whether the person is considered 
underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. For example, the final BMI score phrase would be displayed such as, “Your BMI is 24.3421052631579 and 
is considered normal weight”.

BMI Number Scale:
•	Underweight = <18.5
•	Normal weight = 18.5–24.9 
•	Overweight = 25–29.9 
•	Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater
